# Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs is an addon that adds dynamic pins to your world map. It is meant to help you quickly see which quests, treasures and vignettes are available to pick up in any given zone without having to check any external resources.

A great deal of care has been taken to make sure that the addon is not too obstructive and integrates seamlessly with the map interface.

All data has been verified and tested manually multiple times to make sure that it's as accurate as possible.

## Features

- Show currently available treasures and vignettes on the World Map with helpful tooltips

- Add additional points of interest such as Portals, Profession Trainers and missing Flight Masters to the World Map
- Fix a Blizzard bug that leaves Legion bonus objectives stuck on your World Map after leveling past 50
- Options to choose which features you want to enable
