# Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs is an addon for World of Warcraft that adds dynamic pins to your World Map. It lets you quickly see exactly which Quests, Treasures and Vignettes are available to pick up in any given zone without having to check any external resources. It also adds a few additional quality of life features to your World Map.

A great deal of care has been taken to make sure that the addon integrates with the map interface seamlessly without being obstructing, while using as few resources as possible.

All data has been compiled and tested manually to ensure accuracy.

## Features

- Show currently available Quests on the World Map with accurate locations
- Show currently available Treasures and Vignettes on the World Map with helpful tooltips
- Add additional Points of Interest such as Portals, Profession Trainers and missing Flight Masters to the World Map
- Fix several map related Blizzard bugs/oversights and add missing information for certain quests
- Options to choose which features you want to enable (GUI NYI)

## How to Try

This addon does not currently have an official release available since so much quest data is still missing. That said, it is very stable and the data that *is* there is very accurate. Most of the POI features are also more or less complete.

If you would like to try it out, you can [download the current build from GitHub](https://github.com/glassleo/Breadcrumbs/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). Then extract the folder named ``Breadcrumbs`` (which is inside ``Breadcrumbs-main``) into your AddOns folder.

The addon does have a lot of options available but you'll have to change them manually by editing ``Breadcrumbs.lua`` as there is no in-game GUI implemented for them yet.

## Current Progress

While the addon itself is more or less feature complete, only a tiny fraction of all required data has been compiled and tested so far.

If you'd like to help, please [get in touch](mailto:hello@leo.glass)!

So far, the following zones are entirely complete or in a near-complete state:
- Zereth Mortis and Secrets of the First Ones
- Bastion (Threads of Fate)
- Maldraxxus (Threads of Fate)
- Ardenweald (Threads of Fate)
- Azsuna
- Val'sharah
- Highmountain
- Stormheim
