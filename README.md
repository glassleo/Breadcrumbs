# Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs is an addon that adds dynamic pins to your world map. It is meant to help you quickly see which quests, treasures and vignettes are available to pick up in any given zone without having to check any external resources.

A great deal of care has been taken to make sure that the addon is not too obstructive and integrates seamlessly with the map interface.

All data has been verified and tested manually multiple times to make sure that it's as accurate as possible.

## Features

- Show available quests on the world map with accurate source locations depending on what your character is able to pick, including all side quests
- Show available one-time treasures and vignettes on the world map with helpful tooltips
- Add missing quest objectives for a few specific quests to the world map and minimap
- Customization options are available for scale the pins and choosing exactly which features you want (GUI NYI)
- Fixes a Blizzard bug that leaves Legion bonus objectives stuck on your map after leveling past 50
