# Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs is an addon that adds pins to your world map depending on which quests are available to pick up. The addon is heavily inspired by Wholly and Grail, but built completely from scratch.

While the addon itself is mostly feature complete, only a tiny fraction of all required quest data has been compiled so far.

The following zones are currently more or less done:

- Azsuna
- Val'sharah
- Highmountain
- Stormheim
- Dalaran, Broken Isles (missing profession quests, and artifact quests)
- Azuremyst Isle

Work has begun on:

- Legion Class Order Halls
	- Druid
	- Hunter
	- Monk
- Legion Profession questlines
	- Engineering
